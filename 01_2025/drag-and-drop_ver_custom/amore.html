        <p>The Fair Trade Compliance Program(CP) was introduced in September 2004 with the approval of Amorepacific
          Board of Directors. In this system, companies are encouraged to voluntarily comply with fair trade regulations
          and provided with standards of ethical trading practices that conform to the competition law so that they can
          prevent or detect violations as early as possible and come up with effective countermeasures.</p>

        </div>
        <p>
        <h3 class="h2">Dear Amorepacific colleagues,</h3>
        At Amorepacific, we strive to be a company trusted by our customers, partners, and society. To achieve this, we
        must fulfill our corporate social responsibility through ethical and compliant management.</p>
        <p>To systematically manage our employees' voluntary compliance with fair trade regulations, Amorepacific has
          implemented and operates a <strong>Fair Trade Compliance Program (CP)</strong>. This program is a compliance
          system that companies establish to ensure adherence to fair trade laws. It includes clear codes of conduct,
          education, pre-approval procedures, and monitoring processes to prevent and rectify legal violations.</p>
        <p>I intend to designate 2025 as the inaugural year for reinforcing our <strong>Fair Trade Compliance
            Program</strong>. Guided by our <strong>ABC Spirit</strong>—"We act with integrity and confidence"—we must
          respect the laws and regulations of society to uphold our reputation as a responsible and proud company. The
          company, in turn, will continue to provide full support for the systematic operation of the Fair Trade
          Compliance Program.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">I ask all employees to strictly adhere to the following principles: </p>
        <ol class="ol-list">
          <li><strong>Compliance with fair trade laws and regulations is not optional but essential</strong>. Recognize
            that it forms the foundation for customer satisfaction and strengthening our competitiveness.</li>
          <li><strong>Actively participate in compliance training and fair trade education provided by the
              company.</strong> Familiarize yourself with and follow relevant laws and codes of conduct applicable to
            your responsibilities.</li>
          <li><strong>Ensure thorough review and adherence to pre-approval procedures when handling matters related to
              fair trade.</strong> Conduct business operations with a comprehensive understanding of compliance
            requirements.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Through the <strong>Fair Trade Compliance Program</strong>, we aim to establish a fair and transparent
          management system at Amorepacific. I trust that your unwavering commitment to these principles will serve as a
          stepping stone for our company’s continued growth into a <strong>global leading company</strong>.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your dedication and cooperation.</p>
        <p><strong>Sincerely,</strong></p>

            values</strong> that we must uphold.</p>
        <p>Our CEO has repeatedly emphasized his firm commitment to fair trade compliance and transparent management,
